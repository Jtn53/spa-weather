# Simple Weather

Simple weather single-page app that calls openweather's API, created with the help of Bootstrap and Handlebars.

Known issue: free version of openweather's API does not support HTTPS, so if this weather site is used via HTTPS, the API call won't work.

Site is currently deployed at http://spa-weather.herokuapp.com
